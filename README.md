### Hey, I’m Tolu 👋🏿

- 🏅 I’ve been coding in JavaScript/Typescript for over 10 years.
- 🧐 I stay curious: I’ve also built projects in Ruby on Rails, Python, and Swift.
- 💵 My nickel-to-millionaire pipeline feedback (aka what's said to me a lot): “Hmm, that’s a really good question.”
- 🐰 Coolest Thing I’ve Built So Far (from a user perspective): the “rabbithole” animation you see when you click on an easter egg [here](https://www.theatlantic.com/shadowland/) (Hint: try clicking the moving eye).
- 🎙️ Coolest Thing I’ve Built So Far (from *my* perspective): [sayWord.dev](https://www.sayWord.dev), a platform for sharing and saving meaningful lines of prose. It's an SPA with a Rails backend and React frontend and I learned a lot about DB design, seeding, API best practices, Query caching, and I'm still learning more as I keep iterating. 
- 🚌 An English teacher once taught me to “write for the stranger on the bus,” and that drives both how I code and how I think about UX: how easily will someone be able to enter this experience and comprehend it?
